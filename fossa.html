    <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
    <p>Foosas have semi-retractable claws that they cannot fully retract. They also boast very flexible ankles, which allow them to navigate trees with ease, moving up and down head first and leaping from tree to tree.</p>

    <h2>Habitat and Diet</h2>
    <p>Endemic to <strong>Madagascar</strong>, Foosas are formidable predators. They are primarily nocturnal and diurnal hunters, with over <strong>50% of their diet</strong> consisting of Lemurs. The remainder of their diet includes lizards, various rodents, and birds.</p>

    <h2>Behavior and Lifestyle</h2>
    <p>Foosas are solitary creatures, generally coming together only to mate. They are apex predators in their environment, facing no natural predators themselves.</p>
